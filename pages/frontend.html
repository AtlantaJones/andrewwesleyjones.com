            <p>To me, frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is more about solving problems than anything else.
                I love getting my hands on a great design and figuring out interesting solutions for making them living, breathing sites and web apps.</p>

            <p>I was previously a frontend dev at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com" target="_blank">Big Nerd Ranch</a>
                building web apps with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I worked on various projects, focusing on the visual
                UI side of frontend, responsive design, etc. I'm also skilled with jQuery, Sass and Angular, plus UI frameworks
                like Zurb Foundation and Bootstrap.</p>

            <p>I also wrote <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/about/the-team/andrew-jones/" target="_blank">several blog
                articles</a> for Big Nerd Ranch and contributed chapters to their book on HTML5 web apps. I was also
                a contributor to their Mobile Design course, in addition to being BNR's designated expert in the area of web
                accessibility.</p>

            <p>Most recently, I was senior frontend developer for MoZeus Worldwide, where I built interactive experiential
                web apps for Fortune 500 companies. I led and mentored a team of frontend developers, facilitated team collaboration
                and in-house training sessions. I also did a lot of R&D work to develop techniques for delivering
                new and unique customer experiences.</p>

            <p>I also do (very) occasional speaking, most recently at CSS Summit 2016,
                where I gave <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AtlantaJones/adventures-in-atomic-design" target="_blank">a talk on Atomic Design.</a></p>
