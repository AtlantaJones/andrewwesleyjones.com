            <h1>Front-End Development</h1>

            <p>To me, frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is more about solving problems than anything else.
                I love getting my hands on a great design and figuring out interesting solutions for making them living,
                breathing (accessible) sites and web apps.</p>

            <p>I was previously a frontend dev at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com" target="_blank">Big Nerd Ranch</a>
                building web apps with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I also wrote
                <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/about/the-team/andrew-jones/" target="_blank">several blog
                articles</a> for BNR and was their designated expert in the area of web accessibility.</p>

            <p>Most recently, I've been at If/Then, where I've built VUE.js components in support of large Drupal 8 sites.
                I've also performed web component accessibility reviews for major brands like Coca-Cola, with
                recommendations on how to mediate compliance issues. I also contribute to React components and front end
                development for National Geographicâ€™s CMS platform.
            </p>

            <p>I also do (very) occasional speaking, most recently at CSS Summit 2016,
                where I gave <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AtlantaJones/adventures-in-atomic-design" target="_blank">a talk on Atomic Design.</a></p>
