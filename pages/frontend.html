    <h1>Front-End Development</h1>

    <p>To me, frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is more about solving problems than anything else.
        Some developers are about placing constraints on designers, trying to keep designs boxed into something
        they can easily build. Their first answer is often "no". I prefer to start with a great design and
        figure out interesting solutions to the problems they pose.</p>

    <p>I was previously a frontend dev at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com" target="_blank">Big Nerd Ranch</a>
        building web apps with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I worked on various projects, focusing on the visual
        UI side of frontend, responsive design, etc. I'm also skilled with jQuery, LESS and Sass, plus frameworks
        like Zurb Foundation and Bootstrap.</p>

    <p>I also wrote <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/about/the-team/andrew-jones/" target="_blank">several blog
        articles</a> for Big Nerd Ranch and contribute chapters to our upcoming book on HTML5 web apps. I was also
        a contributor to their Mobile Design course, in addition to being BNR's designated expert in the area of web
        accessibility.</p>

    <p>Most recently, I was senior frontend developer for MoZeus Worldwide, where I built interactive experiential
        web apps for Fortune 500 companies. I led and mentored a team of frontend developers, facilitated team meetings
        and in-house training sessions. I also did a lot of R&D work to develop new techniques for delivering
        new and unique customer experiences.</p>

    <p>I also do (very) occasional speaking, most recently at CSS Summit 2016,
        where I gave <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AtlantaJones/adventures-in-atomic-design" target="_blank">a talk on Atomic Design.</a></p>
