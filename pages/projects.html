    <h1>Web Dev Projects</h1>

    <p>A lot of the work I've done the past few years have either been under strict NDA, or are no longer online. But here's some recent stuff I'm proud of.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://pbt.fireboxstudios.com/" target="_blank">Peoples Bank Theatre Website</a></h2>
    <p>I've been working with a group dedicated to renovating and reopening this 1919 theatre since 1997. As they
        got close to their grand opening in January 2016, they were in need of a <a
                href="http://pbt.fireboxstudios.com/" target="_blank">new site</a> (I'd also built every previous
        version).</p>

    <p>Due to the timeline, I ended up designing and building a new site in about 6 days. Built on Wordpress, I used the
        <a href="http://upstatement.com/timber/" target="_blank">Timber framework</a> to allow for totally custom templating,
        bypassing a lot of the usual headaches of using Wordpress's own functions.</p>

    <p>The site is completely responsive for mobile, using the Zurb Foundation framework, and every aspect is totally controllable
        by the client within Wordpress.</p>

    <h2>Fleming's WiNEPAD App</h2>
    <p>This is an HTML5 web app that runs from the home screen on iPads in every Fleming's Steakhouse across the country.</p>
    <p>A single-page app running AngularJS, WiNEPAD is optimized for performance and can run completely offline, thanks
        to localstorage and the HTML5 application cache.</p>
    <p>I also built and maintained the Drupal-based CMS that acts as an API for serving wine, cocktail and other data, customized
        to each restaurant location.</p>
    <p>You can view the live app <a href="http://flemingssteakhouse.com/WiNEPAD" target="_blank">here</a>. NOTE: It may take quite a while to load,
    depending on your location. This is sadly because the main wine database is still coming from on old, inefficient CMS system the client
    has still not migrated away from :(</p>

    <h2><a href="http://www.tcarms.com/" target="_blank">TC Arms Responsive Site</a></h2>
    <p>While I don't endorse the subject matter, I'm supremely proud of <a href="http://www.tcarms.com/" target="_blank">this responsive site</a> I did almost all the frontend code on. (note: that was 3 years ago, so things may have changed)</p>


    <h2><a href="http://emag.fireboxstudios.com" target="_blank">Wells Fargo eMags</a></h2>
    <p>I built this “<a href="http://emag.fireboxstudios.com" target="_blank">e-Magazine</a>” for Wells Fargo Bank as a single-page experience using JavaScript and jQuery.
        With the exception of the calculator, I built out all the HTML, CSS and scripting.</p>

    <p>Accessibility is also a huge factor for Wells Fargo, so I also made the entire experience completely
        keyboard and screen reader accessible, a feat that we originally thought would be unattainable. </p>

    <!--<h2>Wells Fargo Envision Tool</h2>-->
    <!--<p>This is a <a href="https://www.wellsfargoadvisors.com/envisionyourgoals/envision-tool.htm" target="_blank">card-sorting tool</a> I built for Wells Fargo as well. It features drag-and-drop sorting of cards that prioritize-->
        <!--your goals and concerns about retirement.</p>-->

    <!--<p>As with their eMags, accessibility is a major priority, and this tool is also totally keyboard and screen reader accessible.-->
        <!--And let me tell you, making drag-and-drop accessible is no easy feat.</p>-->


    <h2>Sports Illustrated GameFlash</h2>
    <p>At Turner Sports, I did front-end development on the Sports Illustrated website. I
        was part of a small team dedicated to building a web app called "GameFlash", which is a
        real-time "second screen" experience for watching live sports.</p>

    <p>We built two versions of GameFlash, one for NCAA football, and one for NFL games.
        The apps utilize Turner's high-capacity data centers to pull JSON-formatted game stats
        every few seconds and dynamically update the entire page, which includes a graphical
        representation of the playing field.</p>

    <p>My parts of the app included polling for data every few seconds, parsing it and
        populating things like scoreboards, box scores, play-by-plays, player stats and more. All
        this utilizing object-oriented javascript and jQuery for fast data population.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Gameflash has since morphed into something else so there's no working version to show. But trust me, it was cool :)</p>
