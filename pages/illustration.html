    <h1>Illustration</h1>

    <p>While I've been a developer over 20 years now, I've been an artist my entire life.</p>

    <p>I use multiple mediums, from digital to pencil to watercolor to airbrush. I've created everything from sketch cards to
    avatars to paintings to full-size movie posters, and always looking for a new artistic challenge</p>
