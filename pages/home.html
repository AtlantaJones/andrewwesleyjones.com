    <h1>Greetings!</h1>
    <p>My name is Andrew Jones, and I'm what you'd call a jack-of-all-trades web developer. I've been doing this professionally for the past 20+ years.</p>

    <p>My specialty is frontend development, but I have some experience with PHP and mySQL.</p>

    <p>My ideal gig is to work with developers and designers that are passionate about creating, building and improving web sites and apps for small to medium-sized businesses and organizations. I believe in code as art, and I sweat the details. I'm drawn to working environments where people genuinely love what they do and care that it's done right.</p>
