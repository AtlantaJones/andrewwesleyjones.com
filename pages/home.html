    <p>Hi, my name is Andrew Jones, and I'm what you'd call a jack-of-all-trades web developer. I've been doing this professionally for the past 20 years.</p>

    <p>My specialty is frontend development, but I've done a lot of back-end work with PHP and mySQL.</p>

    <p>I'm looking for a casual atmosphere, working with like-minded geeks dedicated to building cool products and perfecting their craft. I believe in code as art, and I sweat the details. I'm drawn to working environments where people genuinely love what they do and care that it's done right.</p>
