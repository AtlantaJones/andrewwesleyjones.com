    <h1>Back-End Development</h1>

    <p>I've been working with PHP and mySQL since about 2001. And in 2004, I built my own content management
        system and honed it for many years. While I was running my own freelance shop full-time, I put
        nearly all my clients on it, some of which are still enjoying to this day. The CMS was a wonderful learning
        platform and it instilled in me the love of building software.</p>

    <p>During most of 2010, I did a lot of back-end development in support of Facebook applications. My
        framework of choice at that time was CodeIgniter, but I've since started building apps with
        Laravel. I've also become skilled at building sites with Drupal 7, including those with RESTful web
        services. And I've also begun building smaller sites with Wordpress, coupled with the Timber framework. </p>

    <p>Later in 2017, I'll be building a new web app aimed at cartoonists and comic artists. Called
        <a href="http://OpenForCommissions.com" target="_blank">OpenForCommissions.com</a>, it will be a new
        platform for artists to more easily announce, sell, track and deliver art commissions to customers. This tool
        will also likely be built on Laravel and Angular</p>
