        <h1>Back-End Development</h1>
        <p>I've been working with PHP and mySQL since about 2001. And in 2004, I built my own content management
            system and honed it for many years. While I was running my own freelance shop full-time, I put
            nearly all my clients on it, some of which are still enjoying to this day. The CMS was a wonderful learning
            platform and it instilled in me the love of building software, and by extension, making work easier for the people that use it.</p>

        <p>During most of 2010, I did a lot of back-end development in support of Facebook applications. My
            framework of choice at that time was CodeIgniter, but I've since started building apps with
            Laravel. I'm also experienced at building sites with Drupal 7, including those with RESTful web
            services that serve separate front-ends. I also build smaller sites with Wordpress, coupled with the Timber framework for custom theming.</p>

        <p>While I'm very comfortable working with PHP, I consider myself first and foremost a front end developer. I'm happy to assist
        on the back end where needed, but prefer to focus on the UI side these days.</p>
