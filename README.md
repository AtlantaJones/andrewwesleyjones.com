# My resume website

This is the code repository for my resume site at [andrewwesleyjones.com](http://andrewwesleyjones.com). 

While some of the tooling and workflow may be a little overkill for such a small single-page-app, I hope it gives the viewer a good sense of how I normally structure a front-end project. 

Feel free to click around the source, or [click here](http://andrewwesleyjones.com/pdf/Andrew_Jones_Resume-2018.pdf) to download a PDF version of my resume. 

Thanks for stopping by!
